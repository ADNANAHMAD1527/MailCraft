MailCraft: Simplified Email Automation


MailCraft is a simple Java app that automates the process of creating a company email address. By entering your first and last name, and selecting a department (Sales, Development, Accounting, or None), the app generates a custom email address for you. It also creates a secure, random password to go along with it, and you can easily change it anytime.

The app also lets you set your mailbox capacity, add an alternate email, and view your email details. It's a quick and easy way to set up an email system with all the essential features to manage your account, making email setup hassle-free.
